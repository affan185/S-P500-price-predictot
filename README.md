StockPredictor is a supervised machine learning model designed to forecast short-term movements of the S&P 500 index. It uses historical market data and technical indicators (such as moving averages) as input features. A Logistic Regression classifier is trained to predict the directional movement of the index (up or down) on the next trading day. The model's performance is evaluated using a custom backtesting framework with rolling train-test splits to simulate real-time prediction scenarios.
